            This past weekend, I took on the challenge of building a Playlist
            Manager application that integrates with Spotify, armed with nothing
            but vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a touch of Tailwind CSS.
            Juggling university classes and work, I embarked on this coding
            adventure, part of my Full Stack Web Development course at Uplift
            Code Camp.
          </p>

            <h2 class="article__section-title">The Challenge</h2>
            <ul class="article__list">
              <li>
                Build a fully functional web app for managing Spotify playlists.
              </li>
              <li>Use only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</li>
              <li>Incorporate Tailwind CSS for styling.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

            <h2 class="article__section-title">The Pre-Design Dilemma</h2>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              Before diving into the code, I hit a crossroad: should I spend
              precious time designing the app in Figma, or jump straight into
              development? With just one weekend to bring this project to life,
              amidst a busy schedule filled with university and work
              commitments, I was hesitant. But, deciding to lay a solid
              foundation, I took to Figma, sketching out my vision for the app.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              This decision turned out to be a game-changer. Designing first
              helped crystallize my ideas, allowing me to visualize the end
              product. It streamlined the development process, as I had a clear
              blueprint to follow. With the design in place, exporting assets in
              the correct sizes and making design decisions became a breeze,
              eliminating guesswork and speeding up development.

          <section class="article__section">
            <h2 class="article__section-title">The Adventure Begins</h2>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              The development kicked off with constructing the `SpotifyAPI`
              class, my bridge to Spotify. Then, the `PlaylistManager` class,
              dealing with recommendations, playlist staging, and integration
              with Spotify. For the UI, I combined HTML and Tailwind CSS for a
              clean, efficient design process.

            <ul class="article__list">
              <li>
                State Management and UI Updates required a deeper understanding
                of vanilla JavaScript.
              </li>
              <li>
                API Rate Limits and Error Handling needed careful strategy to
                keep the user experience smooth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tailwind CSS was a breeze for applying styles, proving its worth
                in streamlining the design process.

            <p class="article__paragraph">
              The integration of Spotify into my project necessitated navigating
              the OAuth authentication process, a critical step for accessing
              Spotify's API securely. Without prior classroom discussion on
              OAuth, I relied entirely on my diligence in reading and
              deciphering Spotify's extensive documentation.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              Implementing OAuth was like solving a puzzle with pieces from
              different boxes. I had to understand the authentication flow
              thoroughly—from obtaining tokens and refreshing them to securing
              user sessions—each step meticulously followed to ensure a secure
              and functional application.

              Reflecting on this whirlwind weekend, diving into the project with
              a solid design plan in hand was immensely rewarding. The blend of
              vanilla technologies and Tailwind CSS, paired with a
              well-thought-out design from Figma, made building the Playlist
              Manager not just feasible, but enjoyable. It reinforced the power
              of preparation and the impact of visual planning on coding
              efficiency. Check out the app here:

              with less! 🎉🎵
