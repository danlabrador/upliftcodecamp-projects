          Despite resorting to low-code/no-code automations, our IT infrastructure in My Amazon Guy is diverse and integrated, revolving around platforms such as Zapier, HubSpot, Slack, and Asana. This complexity necessitates a well-defined process to navigate our Quality Assurance (QA) tasks efficiently. So, our team developed system testing procedure that is specifically tailored for thorough testing of integrations and automations in our low-code/no-code environments. Here are some key insights and tips from our process that can be beneficial for anyone looking to conduct manual testing.

            From the initial phase of understanding business requirements to the final steps of reporting and feedback, each phase plays a crucial role in shaping the end product. We emphasize the importance of detailed planning, systematic execution, meticulous documentation, and clear communication throughout the process. Our use of tools and platforms, coupled with a collaborative team effort, ensures that our testing is not only thorough but also efficient and adaptable to the evolving needs of our systems.
